This is a Julia rewrite of the [python tool](https://github.com/kaaiian/CBFV) to create a composition-based feature vector representation for machine learning with materials science data. The ideas and methodology are discussed in the recent article:

## Example Use

The input data set should have a least two columns with the header/names `formula` and `target`.

```@example
using DataFrames
using CBFV
data = DataFrame("name"=>["Rb2Te","CdCl2","LaN"],"bandgap_eV"=>[1.88,3.51,1.12])
rename!(data,Dict("name"=>"formula","bandgap_eV"=>"target"))
features = generatefeatures(data)
```

The thing to note is you most likely will still want to post-process the generated feature data using some transformation to scale the data. The [StatsBase.jl](https://juliastats.org/StatsBase.jl/stable/transformations/) package provides some basic fetures for this, although the input needs to be `AbstractMatrix{<:Real}` rather than a `DataFrame`. This can be achieved using `generatefeatures(data,returndataframe=false)`

## Supported Featurization Schemes

As with the orignal CBFV python package the following element databases are available:

- `oliynyk` (default): Database from A. Oliynyk.
- `magpie`: [Materials Agnostic Platform for Informatics and Exploration](https://bitbucket.org/wolverton/magpie/src/master/)
- `mat2vec`:  [Word embeddings capture latent knowledge from materials science](https://github.com/materialsintelligence/mat2vec)
- `jarvis`: [Joint Automated Repository for Various Integrated Simulations provided by U.S. National Institutes of Standards and Technologies.](https://jarvis.nist.gov/)
- `onehot`: Simple one hot encoding scheme, i.e., diagonal elemental matrix.
- `random_200`: 200 random elemental properties (I'm assuming).

However, `CBFV.jl` will allow you to provide your own element database to featurize with. Also, the current implementation reads the saved `.csv` file in [`databases`](@ref), however, this is prone to potential issues (ex. out of date files). To alleviate this I will change the implementation to utilize `Pkg.Artificats` with a `Artificats.toml` file that enables grabbing the datafiles needed from a server if they don't exist locally already.

### Julia Dependencies
This is a relatively small package so there aren't a lot of dependencies. The required packages are:

- CSV
- DataFrames
- ProgressBars
